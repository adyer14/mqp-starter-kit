abstract={Approaches in security visualization have made significant progress in addressing challenges in the ever changing landscape of network security. However, many approaches are limited in both scope and scale, especially when we consider the complexity of the complete security analysis process. In this article, we review several notable recent systems in security visualization, examining their relative strengths and limitations. We then show that recent research in general network visualization, which often deals with domains other than security, provides new visual metaphors and interaction techniques that will help address limitations in security visualization systems. We examine several of these network visualization approaches in detail, and discuss how they can be applied to meet the challenges of the next generation of security visualization systems.},

The overall goal of a Visualization Toolkit is to provide a library that can be used by professionals to construct appropriate visualizations so as to allow their data to be understood and used in decision‐making. This article defines the major components of a visualization toolkit and provides details on how they can be implemented and the consequences and restrictions imposed by those decisions.

pages={284-291},
abstract={A method for visualizing hierarchically structured information is described. The tree-map visualization technique makes 100% use of the available display space, mapping the full hierarchy onto a rectangular region in a space-filling manner. This efficient use of space allows very large hierarchies to be displayed in their entirety and facilitates the presentation of semantic information. Tree-maps can depict both the structure and content of the hierarchy. However, the approach is best suited to hierarchies in which the content of the leaf nodes and the structure of the hierarchy are of primary importance, and the content information associated with internal nodes is largely derived from their children.< >;This paper describes a novel method for the visualization of hierarchically structured information.

title={NV: Nessus vulnerability visualization for the web},
publisher={ACM},
pages={25-32},
abstract={Network vulnerability is a critical component of network security. Yet vulnerability analysis has received relatively little attention from the security visualization community. This paper describes nv, a web-based Nessus vulnerability visualization. Nv utilizes treemaps and linked histograms to allow security analysts and systems administrators to discover, analyze, and manage vulnerabilities on their networks. In addition to visualizing single Nessus scans, nv supports the analysis of sequential scans by showing which vulnerabilities have been fixed, remain open, or are newly discovered. Nv operates completely in-browser, to avoid sending sensitive data to outside servers. We discuss the design of nv, as well as provide case studies demonstrating vulnerability analysis workflows which include a multiple-node testbed and data from the 2011 VAST Challenge.},

volume={2002-},
pages={49-63},
abstract={An attack graph is a succinct representation of all paths through a system that end in a state where an intruder has successfully achieved his goal. Today Red Teams determine the vulnerability of networked systems by drawing gigantic attack graphs by hand. Constructing attack graphs by hand is tedious, error-prone, and impractical for large systems. By viewing an attack as a violation of a safety property, we can use off-the-shelf model checking technology to produce attack graphs automatically: a successful path from the intruder's viewpoint is a counterexample produced by the model checker In this paper we present an algorithm for generating attack graphs using model checking as a subroutine. Security analysts use attack graphs for detection, defense and forensics. In this paper we present a minimization analysis technique that allows analysts to decide which minimal set of security measures would guarantee the safety of the system. We provide a formal characterization of this problem: we prove that it is polynomially equivalent to the minimum hitting set problem and we present a greedy algorithm with provable bounds. We also present a reliability analysis technique that allows analysts to perform a simple cost-benefit trade-off depending on the likelihoods of attacks. By interpreting attack graphs as Markov Decision Processes we can use the value iteration algorithm to compute the probabilities of intruder success for each attack the graph.},

pages={283-296},
abstract={To protect critical resources in today’s networked environments, it is desirable to quantify the likelihood of potential multi-step attacks that combine multiple vulnerabilities. This now becomes feasible due to a model of causal relationships between vulnerabilities, namely, attack graph. This paper proposes an attack graph-based probabilistic metric for network security and studies its efficient computation. We first define the basic metric and provide an intuitive and meaningful interpretation to the metric. We then study the definition in more complex attack graphs with cycles and extend the definition accordingly. We show that computing the metric directly from its definition is not efficient in many cases and propose heuristics to improve the efficiency of such computation.},

journal={JD Supra},
abstract={On April 26, 2016, Verizon published its ninth annual Data Breach Investigations Report ("DBIR"), which looks at breach trends, common vulnerabilities, and categories of security incidents that affected organizations in 82 countries last year. The 2016 DBIR analyzes over 64,000 security incidents (events that compromised information's integrity, confidentiality or availability) and 2,260 data breaches (incidents that resulted in confirmed disclosure of data). The 2016 DBIR analyzes over 64,000 security incidents (events that compromised information's integrity, confidentiality or availability) and 2,260 data breaches (incidents that resulted in confirmed disclosure of data). The most serious incidents—those resulting in the most confirmed data breaches—however, were web app attacks, including hacking using stolen credentials and installing malware (908 confirmed breaches) and point of sale or "POS" attacks against environments where debit and credit card retail transactions are conducted (525 confirmed breaches). In the majority of phishing cases, that click allows the attacker to install persistent malware on the victim's computer. In fairness to those who clicked, however, the DBIR notes that the main perpetrators of phishing attacks are sophisticated, with significant time and resources to craft believable "bait": in 2015, 89% of phishing attacks were perpetrated by organized crime syndicates and 9% were perpetrated by state-affiliated actors.
